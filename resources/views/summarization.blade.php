                        <h3>How Does Text Summarization Work?</h3>
                        <p>It's easy to achieve automatic summarization when you search and explore the right type of data that matches your text. A paragraph or summary generator makes use of the initial sources. There are two different techniques through which the summarization is differentiated.
1.Abstractive text summarization, which is based on the semantic relations between the phrases and words. It's just like an individual analyzer, where it analyses the provided text and delivers it in the short version in its own terms. It clearly states context is everything.
2.Extractive text summarization, the summary here depends on weighing the importance and similarities of text or words in a provided document automatically. Our Summarizer tool makes use of the extractive text summarization as it's the best way to summarize without any Copyscape.</p>
